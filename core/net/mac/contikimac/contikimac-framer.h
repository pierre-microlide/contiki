/* CONTIKIMAC_FRAMER_SHORTEST_PACKET_SIZE is the shortest packet that ContikiMAC
   allows. Packets have to be a certain size to be able to be detected
   by two consecutive CCA checks, and here is where we define this
   shortest size.
   Padded packets will have the wrong ipv6 checksum unless CONTIKIMAC_HEADER
   is used (on both sides) and the receiver will ignore them.
   With no header, reduce to transmit a proper multicast RPL DIS. */
